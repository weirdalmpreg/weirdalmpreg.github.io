<center><font size="+1"><p style="color:red"> 9/11/2020 THERE ARE MANY FACTORS THAT PLAY INTO WHY ALFRED "WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC HAS BEEN UNDERGOING MALE PREGNANCY FOR FAR LONGER THAN A NORMAL HUMAN FEMALE. MALES CAN NOT NATURALLY HAVE CHILDREN BECAUSE OF A LACK OF A UTERUS, OR A WOMB. THERE IS SIMPLY NOWHERE A BABY CAN NATURALLY GROW, SO THE FIRST PROCESS IN WEIRD AL'S MALE PREGNANCY IS GROWING A UTERUS, WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN HIS BLOATING AND WHAT APPEARS TO BE A BABY BUMP AS EARLY AS 2014. THEN, THE BABY HAS ROOM TO GROW; BUT WEIRD AL'S LACK OF OVUM, OR EGGS, IS PROBABLY MAKING YOU QUESTION, HOW IN THE WORLD DOES THE BABY ACTUALLY GROW? WELL, ITS NOT ENTIRELY IMPOSSIBLE, AS PROVEN BY WEIRD AL YANKOVIC HIMSELF. ANOTHER FACTOR OF WHY ITS TAKING SO LONG, IS THAT THE BABY HAS TO GROW AND FORM FROM JUST THE SPERM. WHEN INJECTED WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF LIQUID OVUM, A BABY IS ALLOWED TO GROW IN THE MALE BODY - ALBEIT SLOWLY - AS THE TESTOSTERONE IN HIS BODY STUNTS THE BABIES GROWTH, MEANING HE NEEDS TO BE INSIDE HIS BODY LONGER</p><center>

 <center><font size="+1"><p style="color:red"> 9/17/2020 THROUGHOUT "WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC'S GESTATION PERIOD (WHICH MAY LAST UP TO 8 YEARS AS OPPOSED TO THE FEMALE 9 MONTHS) YANKOVIC HAS UNDERGONE NOTICEABLE CHANGLES. HIS BODY HAIR, ONCE EXPOSED TO THE FEMALE HORMONES OF "ESTROGEN" QUITE POSSIBLY AS WELL AS "PROGESTERONE" NOW APPEARS LONG AND SILKY, AS IF HE WERE A BEAUTIFUL WOMEN. ALONG WITH HIS FEMALE HORMONE(S), YANKOVICS STOMACH AND MID TORSO AREA HAVE EXPANDED DUE TO HIS MALE PREGNANCY CAUSING BOTH PHSYICAL PAIN AND A COPIOUS AMOUNT OF STRETCH-MARKS. DUE TO THE INJECTION OF LIQUID OVUM WHICH CREATES A SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR A FETUS TO FORM, HORMONES WHICH AID GROWTH OF YAKNOVICS FETUS ARE PRODUCED AT AN EXTREME RATE. THIS EXPOSURE TO FEMALE HORMONE(S) MAY ALSO ACCOUNT FOR AL'S PERSONALITY AND EMOTIONS. THESE WILD EMOTIONS SUCH AS MOOD SWING AND MANIA MAY BE CHANNELED INTO AND MASKED BY HIS MUSICAL PERFORMANCES. OTHER EMOTIONS AND SYMPTOMS OF THE FEMALE HORMONE(S) MAY BE weight gain, hot flashes, anxiety or migraines. SYMPTOMS CAUSED BY PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO THE FEMALE HORMONE OR HORMONES EXCRETED FROM THE WOMB AND BRAIN DURING PREGNANCY MAY LAST YEARS.

 <p></p><center><font size="+1"><p style="color:red"> 09/27/2020 "WEIRD" AL'S SILENCE ON ALL SOCIAL MEDIAS, POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF HIS STATE, MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO KEEP CONSTANT REPORTS ON HIS LEVEL OF PREGNANCY. I BELIEVE AROUND NOW HIS BUMP WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO HIDE FROM MOST PEOPLE, PERFECTLY ALIGNED WITH THE RAPID SPREADING OF "COVID-19" IN AMERICA. I BELIEVE FULLY IT IS A COINCIDENCE, AS BLAMING A WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC ON ONE MAN'S PREGNANCY IS FAR TOO CRAZY OF A THEORY WITH NO BACKING. ALTHOUGH I HAVE MY THOUGHTS ON THE SPREAD OF THIS VIRUS, I WILL KEEP THIS WEBSITE FOCUSED ON ONE TOPIC AND ONE TOPIC ONLY (AL'S PREGNANCY/THE EVENTUAL BIRTH OF HIS CHILD). HAVE YOU EVER FOUND IT SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO CONCRETE EVIDENCE THAT "WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC'S WIFE WAS EVER PREGNANT, AND YET THEY HAVE A DAUGHTER? I BELIEVE THAT, ALTHOUGH HE'S BEEN PREGNANT SINCE 2015, HE WAS PREGNANT AGAIN BEFOREHAND FROM AT MOST 1988 TO HER BIRTH IN 2003. NINA YANKOVIC SHARES A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO HER FATHER, MORE SO THAN HER MOTHER, BECAUSE MOST OF HER FORMATION IN THE WOMB WAS THANKS TO AL'S SPERM, AND LESS SO BECAUSE OF SUZANNE YANKOVIC'S LIQUEFIED OVUM, VS IF SUZANNE HAD BEEN PREGNANT, WHICH SHE HAD CLEARLY NOT BEEN. I BELIEVE THIS EXPERIMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT, DESPITE BEING SUCCESSFUL ONCE WITH NINA YANKOVIC, IS STILL UNDER HEAVY CONSTRUCTION. I'M UNSURE WHEN THIS METHOD OF REPRODUCTION WILL BE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC, OR IF IT EVER WILL, BUT PERHAPS ONE DAY, MEN OTHER THAN ALFRED WILL BE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE PREGNANCY AS WELL

 <p></p><p></p><center><font size="+1"><p style="color:red"> 11/5/2020 "WEIRD" AL YANKOVIC MADE AN APPEARANCE ON ADULT SWIM'S "THE ERIC ANDRE SHOW" SEASON 5, EPISODE 3. AT 10 MNUTES AND 53 SECONDS YANKOVIC IS SEEN STATING "MY WORK HERE IS DONE.". THOUGH I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THIS IS REFERRING TO, I NOTICE THE LOWER HALF OF YANKOVIC'S BODY IS SHROUDED IN DARKNESS AS THE CAMERA QUICKLY PANS UP TO HIS FACE, ALMOST AS IF THEY WERE RECORDING ON BORROWED TIME- NEEDING TO QUICKLY DRAW THE ATTENTION AWAY FROM YANKOVIC'S BELLY AND BRINING IT TOWARD HIS FACE... THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEVE AL'S WATER IS CLOSER TO BREAKING THEN WE THINK. THIS MAY BE AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WE ARE ALL ASKING: IF "WEIRD" AL HAD THE TIME TO MAKE AN APPEARANCE ON "THE ERIC ANDRE SHOW", WHY WAS A FULL INTERVIEW NOT CONDUCTED? WHAT DOES AL HAVE TO HIDE FROM THE PUBLIC? THOUGH THE SHOW SEEMS TO BE A SATIRE PARODY BASED ON REAL REALITY SHOWS, QUESTIONS ARE STILL ASKED AND ANSWERS ARE STILL GIVEN. PERHAPS AL WAS WORREID HIS PREGNANCY MAY COME UP IN THE FORM OF A JOKE TOLD BY THE HOST? DUE TO MALE PREGNANCY TAKING LONGER THAN THE NORMAL FEMALE PREGNANCY (MANY YEARS) I BELIEVE IT IS SAFE TO ASSUME THE CYCLES OF PREGNANCY TAKE LONGER THEMSELVES ASWELL. WHEN AL'S WATER BREAKS, THE PAIN OF THE AMNIOTIC SACK BURSTING MAY LAST THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THIS. THE AMNIOTIC SACK IS THE FLUID-FILLED SACK THAT CONTAINS AND PROTECTS A FETUS IN THE WOMB. DUE TO "WEIRD" AL'S LACK OF A WOMB, HIS BODY HAD TO PROVIDE AN ARTIFICIAL SACK. THIS MEANS WHEN HIS SACK, OR "WATER", BREAKS, IT MAY BE ESPECIALLY PAINFUL. I BELIEVE THIS IS DUE TO HAPPEN SOON, STAY TUNED WEIRDALMPREG FANS.

 <p></p><p></p><p></p><center><font size="+1"><p style="color:red"> 11/15/2020 IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT MANY VIEWERS BELIEVE THE WAY I PUNCTUATE "WEIRD" AL YANKOVIC'S NAME IS INCORRECT. I AM AWARE HIS NAME IS "WEIRD AL" YAKNOVIC (I PREVIOUSELY HAVE REFERRED TO HIM AS SUCH.). IT IS A PURPOSEFUL PLAY ON WORDS, I BELIEVE AL IS "WEIRD" DUE TO HIS MALE PREGNANCY, RATHER THAN DUE TO THE WACKY NATURE OF HIS SONGS. STAY TUNED, WEIRD ALLIES. YES. "WEIRD" AL LIES. LIES ABOUT THE STATE AND EXISTENCE OF HIS PREGNANCY. AS TIME GOES ON YANKOVIC WILL INEVITABLY NEAR THE END OF HIS UTERINE CYCLE. I BELIEVE THERE WILL BECOME A POINT THAT AL'S CHILD-BEARING STOMACH WILL GROW TOO BIG TO HIDE. NO GIRDLE OR BELT CAN HIDE THE SECRET "WEIRD" AL YANKOVIC IS HIDING FROM THE PUBLIC. KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED.

NO GIRDLE NOR "CHEST BINDER" CAN HIDE HIS LEVEL OF PREGNANCY. . . THOUGH AL IS NOT OBLIGATED TO POST PHOTOS OF HIMSELF, IT DOES SEEM ODD THAT HE LEAVES HIS LOWER HALF OUT.

@Winter

on the 

@ZappaMovie

- a labor of love, and it definitely shows. The definitive Zappa doc. If you're a fan, it's required viewing". THE PHRASING "A LABOR OF LOVE", COULD BE TEASING AT THE POSSIBILITY OF "WEIRD" AL MAKING HIS PREGNANCY PUBLIC. OR PERHAPS, IF HE LEGALLY IS UNABLE TO ANNOUCE SUCH A THING, A LITTLE HINT OR NUDGE TOWARDS THE ALITES WHO KNOW THE TRUTH?

</p><p></p><p></p><center><font size="+1"><p style="color:red"> 4/16/2021 THE ARTIFICIAL ESTROGEN PUMPING THROUGH AL'S VEINS IS CONSTANTLY AT WAR WITH THE NATURAL TESTOSTERONE PRODUCED BY AL'S TESTES. ARTIFICIAL ESTROGEN IS BOTH ESSENTIAL AND NECESSARY TO HOST A WOMB. AL MAY RECIEVE HIS ESTROGEN THROUGH A NUMBER OF METHODS; ESTROGEN CAN BE INGESTED VIA PILL, GEL, SHOT, OR PATCHES. IT IS CURRENTLY NOT KNOWN HOW MUCH ESTROGEN AL NEEDS TO HOST HIS WOMB. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT AL IS IN CONSTANT NEED OF ESTROGEN AND GETS HIS "FIX" THROUGH DESCRETE ESTROGEN PATCHES APPLIED TO OUT OF SIGHT AREAS SUCH AS THE UNDERARMS, THIGHS, BUTTOCK, OR BACK IN ORDER TO HIDE HIS BIG SECRET. 


</p><p></p><p></p><center><font size="+1"><p style="color:red"> 5/28/2021 RECENTLY, "WEIRD" AL YANKOVIC, AKA ""@alyankovic" ON TWITTER HAS POSTED SEVERAL "TWEETS" ABOUT FOOD. THE FIRST, POSTED ON 05/09/2021 BEARS AN IMAGE OF "PULLED PORK LEMONADE" WITH THE CAPTION "Ugh, my least favorite flavor.". THIS STRANGE FLAVOR COMBINATION MAY BE DUE TO PREGNANCY CRAVINGS, A PHENOMENON WHICH NATURALLY OCCURS IN WOMEN AS EARLY AS 5 WEEKS INTO PREGNANCY. DUE TO THE NATURE OF AL'S PREGNANCY, THIS EFFECT AND MANY OTHERS THROUGHTOUT HIS PREGNANCY MAY BE DELAYED. THOUGH I CANNOT CONFIRM IF AL IS REFERRING TO HIS PREGNANCY CRAVINGS, IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY.

TITLED "The kind youfind in a second hand store?". THOUGH I AM NOT SURE IF THIS IS A REFERENCE TO ONE OF "WEIRD" AL'S SONGS, I AM SURE THAT THE INGREDIENTS USED TO HARBOR AL'S WOMB (AS WELL AS THE PROCESS OF PREGNANCY) ARE CAUSING PREGNANCY FOOD CRAVINGS. THE AVERAGE 60 YEAR OLD WOULD NOT BE CRAVING PASTRIES AT NEARLY 2 IN THE MORNING, BUT, THE AVERAGE PREGNANT WOMAN OR MAN MAY FIND A 2:00 AM SNACK ALLURING DUE TO PREGNANCY CRAVINGS.

YANKOVIC STANDING, ENLARGED HEAD, WITH AN ACCORDION TO COVER HIS ABDOMEN. THE OTHER, A "SIMPSONS" BRAND FIGURE, YELLOWED SKIN AND GREEN SHIRT, ACCORDION ALSO CONVENIENTLY HELD AT HIS LOWER ABDOMEN. I BELIEVE AL, IN AN ATTEMPT TO STAY TRUTHFUL TO HIS FANS, MADE HIS MERCHANDISE "CENSOR" HIS SWOLLEN TUMMY. I WILL NOTE THAT THE "SIMPSONS" FIGURE HAS A REMOVABLE ACCORDION, BUT IT COULD BE THE FAULT OF THE COMPANY, WHICH MR. YANKOVIC MAY NOT HAVE HAD CONTROL OVER. THE AVERAGE FEMALE'S STOMACH EXPANDS GREATLY THROUGHOUT PREGNANCY. THOUGH THE NATURES OF MALE PREGNANCY ARE MYSTERIOUS AND UNKNOWN, IT IS SAFE TO ASSUME THAT IF AL IS HARBORING A SINGLE CHILD, HIS STOMACH-GROWTH-RATE WOULD BE THAT OF A NORMAL HUMAN WOMAN. THE DIRECT CENSORSHIP OF OLD MAN ALFRED'S STOMACH SHOWS THAT "WEIRD" AL HAS SOMETHING TO HIDE.

</p><p style="color:cyan"> QUESTION: "Why was "Weird Al" Yankovic not featured on Kanye West's #DONDA"?
</p><p style="color:red"> ANSWER: THERE ARE MANY POSSIBILITIES. IT US UNSAFE FOR PREGNANT PEOPLE TO TRAVEL WITH THE RECENT SURGE OF THE DELTA VARIANT. ANOTHER MAY BE THAT THE FELLOW CELEBRITIES DO NOT APPROVE OF HIS MALE PREGNANCY.
</p><p style="color:cyan"> QUESTION: "When's the baby coming?"
</p><p style="color:red"> ANSWER: IT IS UNKNOWN. MALE PREGNANCY IS EXPERIMENTAL AND MAY TAKE SEVERAL MORE YEARS TO COME TO COMPLETION. THERE IS EVIDENCE OF AL'S PREGNANCY DATING AS FAR AS 2014.

</p><p style="color:cyan"> QUESTION: "Why"
</p><p style="color:red"> ANSWER: THOUGH I CANNOT SPEAK FOR AL HIMSELF, THERE ARE MANY POSSIBLE REASONS. TO ADVANCE THE TECHNOLOGY, PERSONAL GAINS, TO EXPERIENCE THE JOYS OF PREGNANCY, OR POSSIBLY, TO FURTHER ENHANCE HIS "WEIRD" STATUS.

I BELIEVE IT IS NO COINCIDENCE THIS CHARACTER WAS PLACED NEXT TO MR. YANKOVIC, INSTEAD OF THE OTHER POSSIBLE CHARACTERS (FOOFA, TOODEE, MUNO, BROBEE, ECT.) "PLEX" FEATURES A YELLOW ROBOTIC CHARACTER, WITH A BLACK SPEAKER ABOVE A SMALL DOOR PLACED ON HIS STOMACH. SUSPICIOUSLY IN THE SAME PLACE A BABY BUMP WOULD FORM. A DOOR, SIGNIFYING THE WOMB A BABY WOULD FORM IN AND BE BIRTHED FROM. HE WAS WITH NO DOUBT DESIGNED WITH FE/MALE PREGNANCY IN MIND. HIS PLACEMENT NEXT TO ALFRED YANKOVIC (WHO IS COVERING THE SAME AREA ON HIS BELLY THAT "PLEX" HAS HIS DOOR CONTRAPTION) IS NO ACCIDENT.

AS THE INTERVIEWS ARE SPLICED, AL'S INCLUSION OF THIS PREGNANCY MENTION WAS INTENTIONAL. AL ASKS MADONNA, "I HEAR YOU ARE HAVING A BABY" TO WHICH SHE RESPONDS, "YES". AL THEN ASKS HER "HOW COME YOU CAN HAVE A BABY, AND I CAN'T?". SHE THEN RESPONDS WITH "I THINK A LOT OF IT HAS TO DUE WITH THE FACT THAT I AM A WOMAN". THIS PSUEDO-INTERVIEW TOOK PLACE IN 1996, EIGHT YEARS BEFORE THE EVENTUAL FEMALE BIRTH OF NINA YANKOVIC, AL'S FIRST CHILD. THIS IS ONE OF THE EARLIEST DISPLAYS OF ALFRED'S DESIRE TO BECOME MALE PREGNANT. WITH FANS PROVIDING THEIR INSIGHT ALONG WITH FIRST PERSON ACCOUNTS OF YANKOVIC SIGHTINGS, I HAVE BEEN PAINTING A MORE ACCURATE PICTURE OF THE "WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC MALE PREGNANCY TIMELINE.

SHE REGRETFULLY INFORMED ME SHE HAD NOT SAVED THE ORIGINAL VIDEO, BUT WE THEORIZE IT WAS AN EXTENDED CUT, FEATURING WEIRD AL REVEALING HIS PREGNANT STATE.

<p><center><font size="+1"><p style="color:red"> 9/11/2022: THERE ARE MANY FACTORS THAT PLAY INTO THE "WEIRD" AL MALE PREGNANCY THEORY.  
FIRST: WE HAVE SEEN AL'S BUMP! THROUGHOUT THE YEARS, AL'S STOMACH HAS BEEN EXPANDING AT A RAPID RATE. MOST NOW KNOW THAT EXPERIMENTAL MALE PREGNANCY TAKES FAR LONGER THAN THE AVERAGE FEMALE PREGNANCY, AT THIS RATE, IT IS MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION THAT A MALE PREGNANCY IS AT LEAST 12x A FEMALE PREGNANCY (MEANING A MALE PREGNANCY TAKES 9 YEARS AS OPPOSED TO THE FEMALE 9 MONTHS) . THE EARLIEST ACCOUNT OF "WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC'S MALE PREGNANCY ACCORDING TO WWW.WEIRDALMPREG.COM IS 2014. THE 9TH YEAR IS APPROACHING. 
SECOND: YANKOVIC HAS REFERENCED MALE PREGNANCY THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE. IN YANKOVICS SONGS HE REVEALS HIS SECRET: A MALE PREGNANCY. POINTING TO PHOTOS OF HIMSELF ASKING "ARE YOU PREGNANT?" THE IDEA OF A PREGNANCY IN YANKOVIC IS NOT UNIQUE TO THIS BLOG... FANS HAVE TAKEN IT AMONG THEMSELVES TO CREATE WEIRD AL STYLE PARODY VIDEOS SUCH AS "Oops Im Pregnant Again" PUBLISHED 2008, SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST SIGHTING OF ALFRED'S BABY BUMP. 
THIRD: WEIRD AL YANKOVIC ABSTAINS FROM DRUGS AND ALCOHOL, MAKING HIM THE PERFECT HOST. DOING THIS MAKES HIS BODY PURE, AND ABLE TO GROW A PERFECT WOMB TO HOST HIS "LITTLE YANKOVIC JR." WITHOUT COMPLICATIONS.
FOURTH: FANS OF YANKOVIC HAVE NOTICED THAT ALONG HIS TOUR YANKOVIC HAS PERFORMED SITTING SEVERAL TIMES. YANKOVIC HAS RELEASED A MOVIE ABOUT HIS LIFE WITHOUT APPEARING IN IT HIMSELF POSSIBLY DUE TO HIDING HIS SECRET MALE PREGNANCY.  PREGNANCY TAKES A TOLL ON A BODY, IF AN ARTIFICIAL MALE PREGNANCY TAKES LONGER THAN THAT OF A FEMALE, IT CAN BE ASSUMED THAT THE STRAIN PUT ON THE BODY IS ALSO 12x MORE.

<p><center><font size="+1"><p style="color:red"> 11/4/2022: WHILE PERUSING A “WEIRD AL” FANS FACEBOOK PAGE, I STUMBLED UPON A COMMENT BY ONE EMILY T. SHE DETAILS HER EXPERIENCE AT ONE OF YANKOVIC’S RECENT SHOWS, SAYING DURING THE MEET AND GREET, YANKOVIC WAS CONCEALED BEHIND AN OPAQUE PLASTIC SCREEN. QUOTE “Sitting the whole time…”. IF YOU ARE A LONGITME READER OF MY BLOG, YOU WOULD AGREE IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT THIS IS A POOR ATTEMPT AT CONCEALING “WEIRD AL” YANKOVIC’S EXPERIMENTAL MALE PREGNANCY. WHAT DOES YANKOVIC HAVE TO HIDE THAT HE NEED COWER BEHIND A PLASTIC CURTAIN WHILE TAKING PHOTOS WITH FANS? HE DOES NOT WANT US GETTING CLOSE. THIS PROCESS GIVES AL AN EXCUSE TO HAVE HIS BELLY PHOTOSHOPPED OUT. BELOW IS EMILY’S EXPERIENCE “MEETING AND GREETING” WEIRD AL”

<p><center><font size="+1"><p style="color:cyan">  “After the show, all the VIP people gathered in the back for the meet and greet.  We did the pics first and were told, at that time, there would be a plastic curtain between us and him, but it'll be photoshopped out. As you can tell, you can see where it was photoshopped. At this point we were being herded like cattle so I, seriously, never really saw him before, or while we were taking our pic. (Not to mention we paid for 2 VIP tickets and only got 1 pic). After the pic, we were hustled back into the theater. After not too long, maybe 10 min, everyone was done with their pics and it was time to "meet" him.  Every time I've gone to one of his concerts (this one was my 5th), I've had him sign my tickets and got a chance to chat with him, tell him how great he is, etc.  This time, he was behind the plastic sheet (to the floor), and all he was doing was signing a poster that he had with him.  When we went up to "meet" him, we had to wear our masks and all I was able to do was say hi before he was finished signing the poster.  And, he wasn't even the one to hand it to me... he gave it to whoever was leading three VIP group and that guy gave it to us.  So, that took less than 5 min... basically I paid $400 for a picture of, pretty much, just myself, and some guy signing posters behind a plastic curtain.  Oh, but wait, we got "mugs" (which would serve better as a pencil holder) and a bag of coffee... woo hoo for being a VIP…”

THE EDITED PORTIONS OF THE PHOTO HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED IN RED FOR EASIER VIEWING. THE ORIGINAL PHOTO IS AVAILABLE ON YANKOVIC'S SOCIAL MEDIA, UNTIL IT IS INEVITEBLY TAKEN DOWN DUE TO MY DISCOVERY

<p><center><font size="+1"><p style="color:red"> 7/20/2024 YESTERDAY, JULY 19TH 2024, A NEW SINGLE WAS RELEASED BY "WEIRD" AL YANKOVIC TITLED "Polkamania!".  OF COURSE THE UNTRAINED EYE MAY NOT NOTICE ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS WHEN VIEWING THIS NEW HIT ON YOUTUBE, BUT THOSE WHO ARE BOTH ASTUTE AND ENLIGHTENED PAY MIND TO HIS SECRET. PLAIN AS DAY, IN THIS VIDEO "WEIRD" AL MAKES SEVERAL REFERENCES TO HIS PREGNANCY, WHETHER INTENTIONAL OR NOT. TWO BLARING SIGNS LIKE SIRENS IN THE MID OF THE SEA OR RAVENS IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT; NOTICE AL'S SPECIFIC SONG CHOICES; THE MOST OBVIOUS BEING A PARODY OF 'Old Town Road' BY Lil Nas X, THOUGH THE SONG ITSELF GIVES NOTHING AWAY MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT MR. X HAS MADE SEVERAL DIRECT REFERENCES TO MALE PREGNANCY. IT IS NO SECRET THAT TECHNOLOGY BEYOND OUR WILDEST DREAMS EXISTS ONLY FOR THE HIGHEST SOCIAL CLASS, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT AL HAS COLLUDED WITH MR. X SEVERAL TIMES, PERHAPS INSPIRING HIS 2021 MALE PREGNANCY PHOTOSHOOT? WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT MR. X AND HIS TEAM TO NO CURRENT AVAIL. THE NEXT SIGN SEEN AT ONE MINUTE AND FIFTY SIX SECONDS IN THE VIDEO, IS A COMMON THEME THROUGHOUT AL'S CAREER- A CACTUS COSTUME WHICH CONVENIENTLY COVERS THE ABDOMEN. THIS SCENE IS THE ONLY LIVE-ACTION SCENE OF THE ENTIRE VIDEO, NEED I SAY MORE? FOUR MINI-PARODIES LATER, AL TACKLES A CONTROVERSIAL HIT- "WAP" BY Cardi B. THOUGH THE PARODY OF THIS SONG MAY SEEM TO ONLY SERVE A HUMOROUS PURPOSE, THOSE OF US WITH HEIGHTENED SENSE CAN'T HELP BUT UNDERSTAND THIS MAY ALLUDE TO THE PROCESS OF LIVE BIRTH KNOWN AS PRELABOR RUPTURE OF MEMBRANES OR IN LAYMANS TERMS "THE WATER BREAKING", IN WHICH AMNIOTIC FLUID BEGINS TO LEAK OUT OF AN INDIVIDUALS UTERUS SIGNALING THAT LIVE BIRTH HAS BEGUN. AN E-MAIL SENT TO AL "WEIRD" AL FANS THIS FRIDAY CONTAINS TWO HIGHLY EDITED IMAGES OF AL, ONE SPORTING HIS CONCEILING CACTUS COSTUME, AND ONE WHICH SHOWS AL KNEEL BEFORE A FLAMING ACCORDION, THE FLAMES CLEARLY EDITED IN POST. WITH THE KNOWLEDGE CONTAINED IN THIS BLOG HAVING BEEN PUBLIC FOR SEVERAL YEARS NEED I COMMENT ON WHY A GRAPHIC MAY BE EDITED OVER THE BELLY OF "WEIRD" AL YANKOVIC? GO FORTH AND SPREAD THE WORD OF WEIRD AL MPREG AND STAY TUNED FOR A NEW FEATURE ON WWW.WEIRDALMPREG.COM COMING SOON.

<p><center><font size="+2"><p style="color:red"> A MESSAGE TO ALL BELIEVERS:

<p><center><font size="+1"><p style="color:red"> OH HOW TIME FLIES. IT FEELS LIKE JUST YESTERDAY THE FIRST UPDATE TO WWW.WEIRDALMPREG.COM WAS PUBLISHED. TO MY LOY AL FANS, WE AT WEIRDALMPREG THANK YOU FOR A CONTINUED FOUR YEARS OF YOUR SUPPORT. AS THE WEIRD AL SECRET MALE PREGNANCY THEORY SPEEDS ACROSS THE GLOBE AT THE SOUND OF LIGHT, AS EVIDENCE PILES UP, WE CAN ONLY HOPE "WEIRD" AL YANKOVIC WILL LET DOWN HIS GUARD AND REVEAL HIS MALE PREGNANCY SECRET TO AN ACCEPTING WORLD. STAY TUNED FOR MORE FEATURES TO THE SITE, SUCH AS A FAN SUBMISSIONS PAGE AS WELL AS A DEEP-DIVE INTO THE LYRICS OF POPULAR "WEIRD AL" YANKOVIC SONGS.

<p><center><font size="+1"><p style="color:red"> 9/23/2024 TODAY TO OUR DELIGHT AND SURPRISE YANKOVIC ANNOUNCED HIS "BIGGER & WEIRDER" 2025 TOUR. IN A MESSAGE SENT TO ALL "WEIRD AL" FANS, A HEADER IMAGE OF AL SHOWS YANKOVIC DESTROYING BUILDINGS AND GRABBING AUTOMOBILES IN A FASHION SIMILAR TO GODZILLA OR KING KONG; A CLASSIC PARODY. IT IS NOT UNTIL YOU LOOK CLOSER THAT THE DEEPER MEANING OF THIS PHOTO IS REVEALED. IN THE FOREGROUND, A WOMAN'S GAZE ALIGNS PERFECTLY WITH YANKOVIC'S WOMB. YANKOVIC'S ABDOMEN PICTURED BELOW SEEMS TO HAVE A DEFINED AND SLIM WAIST STARTING AT THE SECOND VISIBLE BUTTON ON AL'S SHIRT, PHOTO MANIPULATION? PERHAPS, OR PERHAPS A GRIM FACT THAT IS NOT OFT MENTIONED ON THIS BLOG, FAILURE OF PREGNANCY. IT IS LIKELY THAT YANKOVIC IS CURRENTLY INBETWEEN PREGNANCY ATTEMPTS, AND COULD VERY POSSIBLE NOT RESUME ATTEMPTING PREGNANCY UNTIL THE END OF HIS 2025 TOUR. I ATTEMPTED TO CALL THE NUMBER LISTED IN THE LETTER AND ASK ABOUT SUCH SCENARIOS TO NO AVAIL, AND I COULD NOT BE TRANSFERRED UP TO YANKOVIC HIMSELF.
